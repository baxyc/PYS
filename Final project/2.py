#
# <source src="https://datalore-samples.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/getting-started/videos_new/2_Working_with_Data.mp4">
#
# </video></div>


#
# ## Plug in multiple data sources
#
# In Datalore you can work with **various data sources** together in one notebook.
#
# You can connect your **SQL databases** (such as MySQL, Snowflake, PostgreSQL, Redshift, etc.), **bucket storages** (AWS S3, GCS buckets), and **files** (any file types) from the interface and further query and join them in one notebook.
#
# To manage all your data, please use the **Attached data** tab in the left-hand sidebar.
#
# <div><img src="https://datalore-samples.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/getting-started/videos_new/many_datasets2.png" width = 1000 border="2" style="border-color: #d3d3d3; margin-top: 1%;"/></div>


# ## Reusing data connections
#
# When creating a bucket or a database connection, you‚Äôll be able to reuse it across other notebooks in the same workspace.
#
# You can manage all of the attached data sources from the workspace file system and add new connections directly from the notebook interface.
#
# When you share a notebook or a workspace, your credentials **are not exposed to the environment**.
#
# <div><img src="https://datalore-samples.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/getting-started/videos_new/manage_datasources2.png" width = 600 border="2" style="border-color: #d3d3d3; margin-top: 1%;"/></div>


# ## Persistent file storage
#
# Datalore comes with persistent storage for each notebook. This means you can upload your data files directly to **Notebook files**. If you want to share a file across multiple notebooks, attach **Workspace files** to the notebook and upload it there. Workspace files are mounted under the `/data/workspace_files/` directory.
#
# ### Benefits of attaching files to a notebook
#
# - Your workspace file system won't be cluttered with too many files.
# - Notebook files are shared automatically when you invite collaborators to the notebook.
#
# Additionally, you can download data to Notebook or Workspace files or to store it in memory using various Python packages and APIs.


# ## Dataframe exploration
#
# Whenever a pandas dataframe is the result of your cell execution, you get additional tabs in the cell output:
# - **Table** ‚Äì a scrollable table view of your data
# - **Raw** ‚Äì this tab represents the raw output without the ability to scroll the data
# - **Visualize** ‚Äì this tab brings out-of-the box plots to help you visually explore the data
# - **Statistics** ‚Äì this tab provides essential descriptive statistics for your dataframe
#
# ### Task: **Run the code cell above** and navigate to the **Visualize** and **Statistics** tabs!

#
# </video></div>


# ## Preconfigured environment
#
# Each notebook in Datalore has an **isolated environment**. This means that when you apply changes to one notebook, they won't affect any of the other notebook environments.
#
# Datalore comes with a lot of **Python libraries pre-installed**.
#
# We've already installed `pandas`, `NumPy`, `sklearn`, `MatplotLib`, and `Seaborn`, so you can start importing the package you need right away.
#
# Datalore supports both the **pip** and **Conda** package managers. Pip is chosen by default, but you can always switch to Conda.
#
# <div><img src="https://datalore-samples.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/getting-started/videos_new/environment_tab.png" width = 300 border="2" style="border-color: #d3d3d3; margin-top: 1%;"/></div>
#
# ## Installing additional libraries
#
# - To install additional libraries, upgrade package versions, and remove libraries, go to *Environment | Explore tab*. The changes will be written into the .yaml file, which will be stored in your Notebook files.
# - To install a package from a Git repository, go to *Environment | Repositories*.
# - To install any other dependencies (f.e. non-python dependencies), you can modify the `init.sh` file. It will run before the environment is installed.
#
# üí° Packages installed via the **Environment** tab are **persisted** when you reopen notebooks. You can also install packages using **pip magic commands** or ***Terminal***, but they won't be persisted.
#
# You can learn more about this in the [Environment manager documentation.](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/datalore/environment.html)


# ### Task: Install and import the `datasets` library
#
# 1. Run the code cell below using `Shift+Enter`.
# 2. **Click on the prompt in the error log to search for the datasets library. This prompt will open the *Explore tab* of the *Environment manager*.**
# 3. Click on the datasets library.
# 4. Click the Install button.
# 5. Restart the kernel.
# 6. Rerun the cell.
